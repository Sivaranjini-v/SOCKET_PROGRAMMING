# SOCKET_PROGRAMMING
Created a socket-based communication program using the TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) protocol. In this program,implemented code on the server side that reverses a word and sends it back to the client. Essentially, your server and client are engaged in a back-and-forth exchange where the server manipulates the data (reverses the word) before returning it to the client.
